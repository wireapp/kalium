# API

Public API definitions and contracts exposed by Kalium library.

**Purpose:** Reserved for future public API surface definitions, versioned interfaces, and client-facing contracts.

**Dependencies:** Should depend on logic layer to expose its functionality
**Used by:** External consumers of Kalium library (e.g., Wire Android app)
**Guidelines:** Keep API surface minimal and stable. Breaking changes require version bumps. Document all public APIs thoroughly.
**Status:** Currently empty - placeholder for future API boundary layer.
